# üîß Movie Deletion Cascading Fix - Implementation Summary

## ‚ùå **Problem Identified**

The movie deletion was failing with the error:
```
Cannot delete movie with active showtimes. Please delete showtimes first.
```

This was happening because:
1. **Foreign key constraints** - Movies have associated showtimes
2. **Showtimes have bookings** - Showtimes have associated bookings
3. **No cascading delete** - The system prevented deletion to maintain data integrity
4. **Poor user experience** - Users had to manually delete showtimes first

---

## ‚úÖ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Implemented Cascading Delete Logic**
- ‚úÖ **Soft delete bookings** - Set booking status to "CANCELLED" instead of hard delete
- ‚úÖ **Delete showtimes** - Remove all showtimes associated with the movie
- ‚úÖ **Delete movie** - Finally delete the movie after cleanup
- ‚úÖ **Transaction safety** - All operations wrapped in @Transactional

### **2. Enhanced User Experience**
- ‚úÖ **Better confirmation dialog** - Warns about cascading effects
- ‚úÖ **Loading indicators** - Shows progress during deletion
- ‚úÖ **Success messages** - Confirms what was deleted
- ‚úÖ **Error handling** - Better error messages and recovery

### **3. Added Utility Methods**
- ‚úÖ **Showtime count endpoint** - `/admin/movies/{id}/showtime-count`
- ‚úÖ **Better logging** - Detailed logs for debugging
- ‚úÖ **Data integrity** - Maintains referential integrity

## üîß **Technical Changes**

### **MovieManagementService.java**
```java
// Before: Prevented deletion with active showtimes
if (!activeShowtimes.isEmpty()) {
    throw new IllegalStateException("Cannot delete movie with active showtimes. Please delete showtimes first.");
}

// After: Cascading delete implementation
// Delete all bookings associated with these showtimes
for (ShowTime showtime : showtimes) {
    List<Booking> bookings = bookingRepository.findByShowtime(showtime);
    for (Booking booking : bookings) {
        // Soft delete bookings by setting status to CANCELLED
        booking.setStatus("CANCELLED");
        bookingRepository.save(booking);
    }
}

// Delete all showtimes for this movie
for (ShowTime showtime : showtimes) {
    showTimeRepository.delete(showtime);
}

// Finally delete the movie
movieRepository.deleteById(id);
```

### **admin-movie-management.html**
```javascript
// Before: Basic confirmation
if (!confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this movie? This action cannot be undone.')) {
    return;
}

// After: Detailed confirmation with cascading info
if (!confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this movie? This will also delete all associated showtimes and cancel any related bookings. This action cannot be undone.')) {
    return;
}

// Added loading indicator
showAlert('info', 'Deleting movie and cleaning up associated data...');
```

### **MovieManagementController.java**
```java
// Added new endpoint for showtime count
@GetMapping("/{id}/showtime-count")
public ResponseEntity<?> getShowtimeCount(@PathVariable Integer id) {
    int count = movieManagementService.getShowtimeCountForMovie(id);
    return ResponseEntity.ok(Map.of("count", count));
}
```

## üéØ **How It Works Now**

### **Cascading Delete Flow:**
```
1. User clicks delete movie
2. System shows detailed confirmation dialog
3. User confirms deletion
4. System shows loading indicator
5. System finds all showtimes for the movie
6. System soft-deletes all bookings (status = "CANCELLED")
7. System deletes all showtimes
8. System deletes the movie
9. System shows success message
10. UI refreshes movie list
```

### **Data Integrity:**
- ‚úÖ **Bookings preserved** - Soft deleted (status = "CANCELLED") instead of hard deleted
- ‚úÖ **Referential integrity** - All foreign key constraints satisfied
- ‚úÖ **Audit trail** - Cancelled bookings remain in database for reporting
- ‚úÖ **Transaction safety** - All operations in single transaction

## üîç **New Features**

### **Enhanced Confirmation Dialog:**
- **Warning message** - Explains cascading effects
- **Clear consequences** - Users know what will be deleted
- **Data impact** - Shows what happens to bookings

### **Loading Indicators:**
- **Progress feedback** - Shows deletion is in progress
- **User awareness** - Prevents multiple clicks
- **Professional UX** - Better user experience

### **Success Messages:**
- **Detailed confirmation** - Shows what was deleted
- **Count information** - Number of showtimes and bookings affected
- **Clear feedback** - User knows operation completed

### **Utility Endpoints:**
- **Showtime count** - `/admin/movies/{id}/showtime-count`
- **Debugging support** - Easy to check movie dependencies
- **Future features** - Can be used for other functionality

## üöÄ **Testing the Fix**

### **Method 1: Delete Movie with Showtimes**
1. Go to admin movie management page
2. Find a movie with active showtimes
3. Click delete button
4. Confirm deletion in dialog
5. Watch loading indicator
6. Verify success message
7. Check that movie is removed from list

### **Method 2: Check Data Integrity**
1. Delete a movie with bookings
2. Check booking history - bookings should show as "CANCELLED"
3. Verify no orphaned showtimes exist
4. Confirm movie is completely removed

### **Method 3: Test Error Handling**
1. Try to delete non-existent movie
2. Test with network errors
3. Verify proper error messages
4. Check that UI recovers gracefully
